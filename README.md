  <strong>A modern NAS appliance built on bcachefs.</strong><br>
  Designed for homelabs and small teams.

---

NASty is a self-contained NAS operating system that turns commodity hardware into a full-featured storage appliance. It combines bcachefs (the most exciting Linux filesystem in years) with NixOS (atomic updates, instant rollback) and a web-based management interface.

## Features

- **bcachefs filesystems** — compression, checksumming, erasure coding, tiering, encryption, O(1) snapshots
- **File sharing** — NFS, SMB, iSCSI, NVMe-oF — all managed from one UI
- **Web UI** — manage filesystems, subvolumes, snapshots, shares, disks, VMs, and more
- **Web terminal** — built-in shell access from the browser
- **Virtual machines** — QEMU/KVM with browser-based VNC console
- **Apps** — run containerized services on the appliance
- **Alerts** — configurable rules for filesystem usage, disk health, temperatures
- **Kubernetes integration** — CSI driver for dynamic volume provisioning across all 4 protocols
- **Atomic updates** — NixOS-based, with one-click rollback to any previous generation
- **File browser** — browse and manage files on your filesystems from the web UI

## Getting Started

Download the latest ISO from [Releases](../../releases) and boot it on your hardware. The installer walks you through disk selection and initial setup.

Default credentials: **admin** / **admin**
